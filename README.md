# JASC Palette Thumbnailer

Generates thumbnails for JASC palette files

Build with `./build.sh build_binary`.

The install script worked on at least one Ubuntu 18.10 with GNOME nautilus 3.26.4 device. `./build.sh install`, maybe with a nautilus restart, will make nautilus render \*.pal files with thumbnails generated from this program.
